All .csv files are part of the repository and will load into their respective jupyter file.

## Dictionary
#### The three important files to run are..
<li>Aim1_code.jpynb - Code for aim 1: Characterize resistance training behavior, and mental health, in a sample of men with symptoms of muscle dysmorphia.
<li>Aim2_code.jpynb - Code for aim 2: Explore whether a worse mental health, including symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, are associated with more frequent and intense resistance training behaviors. 
<li>Aim3_code.jpynb - Code for aim 3: Explore any associations between mental health and substance and supplement use.


#### Other jupyter notebook files
<li>Preprocessing MD2_Dataset.ipynb - Focused on specific data cleaning neccesary for the MD2 original file.
<li>DataCleaning.ipynb - Focused on specific data cleaning neccesary for the MD_Acute original file, as well as any final cleaning neccesary once the 2 data sets were combined.
<li>Demographic data and information.ipynb - This was for general information and demographic data on the individuals in our dataset.


#### .csv files
##### Clean, final data sets
<li>combined_dataset_ALL.csv - Contains individuals with and without Muscle Dysphoria.
<li>combined_dataset.csv - Only contains individuals with Muscle Dysphoria.

##### Other .csv files
<li>MD2_Data_set.csv - The original MD2 dataset, no preproccesing
<li>MDACUTE_Database.csv - The original MDACUTE dataset, no preproccesing
<li>PREPROCESSED_MD2_Database_2.1.csv - Early preprocessing that was completed in Excel instead of python.
